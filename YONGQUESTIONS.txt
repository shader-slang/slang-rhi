Pipeline refactor
- can we remove runtime specialization? we have to!
- specialize() doesn't lead to a program layout that can be used

Shader program
- can we always create shader program from a "linked program"
- we cannot just have a single linked program passed in
- d3d12 has support for "libraries" where we have individual entry points with different specializations
- how should the interface to create shader programs look like?
